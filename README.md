# Printify Homepage Clone

## Project Overview
This project is a clone of the Printify homepage, built using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. The purpose of the project is to recreate the design and layout of the Printify homepage, incorporating key components such as a Profit Calculator and a Blog Section. This project demonstrates a responsive design that adapts well to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience across devices.

## Features
### Profit Calculator
A section that breaks down the cost and profit of selling a t-shirt, displaying the selling price, production cost, and net profit. It includes a call-to-action button for users to get started.

### Blog Section
A dedicated section showcasing articles with topics related to e-commerce and making money with Printify, along with an email subscription form to capture user interest.

### Responsive Design
The entire page is fully responsive, ensuring it works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used
- **ReactJS**: For creating reusable and dynamic UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and ensuring a consistent, responsive layout with utility-first CSS classes.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For handling interactivity and component logic.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: Tailwind is built on top of modern CSS, allowing rapid and flexible styling.

## Getting Started with Create React App


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
